# StreamScraper

StreamScraper is JavaScript based virtual data stream manipulation engine based on Apache Samza. The idea is to multiplex virtual data streams (where Kafka Key is a stream name) over number of regular Kafka streams. The multiplexing should be managed in a dynamic way and involve JS programming interface and open REST API.
